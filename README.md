# Midland Code Academy Cohort 3 Learning Tracker

This is an Angular project created as a group final project for Cohort 3 of Midland Code Academy.  This application would allow future students and instructors in the Midland Code Academy to store and retrieve daily lesson information, communicate written questions to the instructor and receive answers at any time outside of class, rate their understanding of instruction topics, see the instructor's rating of that same topic and see whether that opinion matches their own, take notes, and complete quizzes with results visible by instructors.

It is designed in Angular 9.0 and utilizes a node.js/express.js back-end server and internal API.   The application uses Open Auth 2.0 via Auth0 to authenticate users with their official @midland.edu gmail accounts and both a PostgreSQL relational database and a MongoDB no-SQL database to store user data.
